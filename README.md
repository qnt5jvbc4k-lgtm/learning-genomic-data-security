Project Title: Learning to Protect Genomic Data


Why I Started This Project:

I have been interested in bioinformatics and cybersecurity throughout high school, but I realized that my understanding of how biological data is used in real-world systems 
was very shallow. At first, I thought bioinformatics was mostly about analyzing DNA sequences and cybersecurity was only about protecting computer systems. 
I did not realize how much these two fields overlap.
As I started reading more about real-world applications, it became clear that my understanding was mostly surface-level. 
This year, I am taking Cybersecurity 1, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Biology to build a stronger foundation. 
While these classes introduced important concepts, they did not fully answer my questions about how bioinformatics and cybersecurity work together. 
This gap in my understanding is what led me to start this project.

What I Hope to Learn:

1 - How genomic data is stored and shared.
2 - Why managing access control is complex in biological contexts.
3 - Where common security assumptions begin to fail.
4 - How breaches might occur and what makes them difficult to prevent.
5 - How documenting my learning process could help other students understand these challenges.

What This Project Is NOT:

1 - Not a medical tool.
2 - Not a real-world deployment.
3 - Not a finished solution.
4 - Not a claim of solving bioinformatics security problems.

Current Scope and Limits:

At this stage, I am focused on learning basic concepts, design ideas, and understanding systems rather than building a complete solution. 
I am not attempting to work with real patient data, deploy a real-time solution, or influence medical or clinical decision-making. 
I am aware of my current limitations and plan to build gradually before attempting more complex designs. 

I plan to continue working on this project over several months, continuously reviewing and revisiting my assumptions. 
As I gain more knowledge and insight, I expect to refine my approach and better understand the challenges involved.
